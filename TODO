List of things to do:

Train movement
    TODO:   Train knows distance, begin and end Station objects. If we ever 
            need to calculate its coordinates, we can write a function for that.
    TODO:   calculate the distances between stations up front and switch
            Train function to look up rather than calculate distance
            evaluate which is faster. 
    TODO:   What do trains do when they are waiting at a station.

Lines:
    Number of trains per line

Time step size, velocity and spawn rates:
    How to integrate these in a coherent fashion.

Day/Night cycles:
    Add day night cycle
    Different spawn rates at different times, and different stations

Visualization of a simulation:
    First steps taken, we can now actually visualize our coordinate system.
    Future ideas:
        Display location of trains, # of passengers in trains/at stations.
        Perhaps we can put a barplot next to each station, or change its color.
        Same for trains.
    Could be interactive, or could just save a snapshot every few steps.
