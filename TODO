List of things to do:

Parse the NYC subway map coordinates
    convert to cartesian

Figure out the description of lines as a network

Train movement
    plan:   Train knows distance, begin and end Station objects. If we ever 
            need to calculate its coordinates, we can write a function for that.

Passenger elimination:
    plan:   Train will carry passengers and only put them on a station if they
            have a transfer. Otherwise, he'll let them off the train to be 
            garbage collected.
