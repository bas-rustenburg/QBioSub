Things we ran into while setting up the model:


Database (in)sanity

Same name, different station. 103 st. 6,7, BC
Different names for same station "Times Square -42nd street and 42nd Street"
"Union Square and 14th Street - Union Square"
Different capitalization of line names
Different connectivities displayed per station (Rockefeller Center: B,D,F,M & B,D,F,M,7)
Typos:  Sr instead of St to abbreviate street.

In order to speed up simulation, we calculate the optimal path between all stations in advance.
